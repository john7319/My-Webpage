# MY PERSONAL PORTIFOLIO

## REQUIREMENTS
* Create a new js file
* Create a css file
* Create folder for the images
* Create a html file

## PROCEDURE
 - In the index.html file, I identified what I need to include in my website/portifolio and implemented it in every way possible. Ensured I linked my css and js file for coordinated running. I added links to my repo and email.
 You can easily access it by clicking this link [My Portifolio](https://john7319.github.io/My-Webpage/)
 - In the styles.css file, I added in all the styling needed to give my website a proper look and attraction to whoever was looking at it.
 - In the js file I implemented it to create a new h1 tag to my website whenever you run it.
